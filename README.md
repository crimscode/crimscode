- 👋 Hi, I’m @crimscode, professional coder and mspaint artist.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding, art and making video content (video editing).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... all stuff HTML5, CSS3 and soon JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. Maybe later!
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure if there is any DM feature on GitHub, but try to contact me somehow! I'll count this as a challenge.
